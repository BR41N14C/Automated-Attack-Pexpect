# Scripts-Dojo
#This script was created for a university assignment.
The goal for this script is to access a server given to us by brute forcing the password (it also assumes that we know the login which is max), this server will contain a lot of text files. So after accessing the server we have to look for emails in these text files we found, and the only way to do that is to scan each text file looking for the "@" which would catch and store every email found into a text file.
